# Bamazon - A BAMHazon Marketplace

## Overview

This project utilizes Node.JS and a MySQL database to browse a marketplace full of potentially useful and fake items. 

### Workflow 
The user is able to select items and quantities from the store front. After a selection is made, the user will either:

1. Be notified with a 'successful purchase' message and invoice detailing items, quantities, and final price. They will then be returned to the inital order page to attempt another purchase with our updated database.

2. Be sent an alert of 'insufficient stock', and have their order rejected. They will then be redirected to our initial order page to try attempt another order. BUY, BABY BUY.
